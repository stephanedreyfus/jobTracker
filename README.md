# A Job Application Tracking App

#### Practicing using Flask, MongoDb, Javascript, and perhaps other things to keep track of all the places I've applied for jobs.

### Functionality I Would Like to Add
- [ ] Drag and drop to change status
- [ ] Modal job entry form
- [ ] Automatically move jobs from rejected to potential after a certain period of time (difference)
- [ ] Generate page to replace placeholder elements
- [ ] Second page for bill tracking
